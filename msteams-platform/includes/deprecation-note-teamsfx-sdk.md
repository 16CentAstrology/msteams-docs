> TeamsFx SDK will be officially deprecated by September 2025, with support continuing until September 2026. We recommend planning your transition to the [Teams AI library](/microsoftteams/platform/teams-ai-library/welcome) for building agents in Microsoft Teams. To extend your agent's capabilities across other Microsoft 365 platforms, use the [Microsoft 365 Agents SDK](/microsoft-365/agents-sdk/).
