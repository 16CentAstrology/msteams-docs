# Promote app awareness and app adoption

As an app developer, once you’ve published your app, one of the key activities you should focus on is driving adoption for your app. You must ensure that users interact with your app and [learn from their usage behavior and feedback](/microsoftteams/teams-analytics-and-reports/app-usage-report), which you can incorporate   back into your Teams app. A few examples of post-publish activities are, deployment and adoption-related engagements, user base growth, support for existing app customers, app updates, and app monetization.
This document provides resources and best practices for you to support the rollout of your Teams app in your customers’ organizations. The personas relevant for you   are business decision makers, IT admins, and end-users. The outcome of an app rollout is  successful adoption   and engagement by the end-users of your customer’s organization.

The personas relevant for you   are business decision makers, IT admins, and end-users. The outcome of an app rollout is  successful adoption   and engagement by the end-users of your customer’s organization.

## Know the prerequisites before your customers rollout your app

Your customers must have the following access to roll out your Teams app:

> 1.Access to Teams
> 2.Access to your apps

### Access to Teams

Customers need to have appropriate licenses to access Teams and use apps in Teams.     To use apps on Teams, users must be signed into  Teams and have a license for [Microsoft 365 Business Basic](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/compare-all-microsoft-365-business-products-b?ef_id=b7ff8842550c11df1d45ebe1bb56eaa1:G:s&OCID=AIDcmmwf9kwzdj_SEM_b7ff8842550c11df1d45ebe1bb56eaa1:G:s&lnkd=Bing_O365SMB_Brand&msclkid=b7ff8842550c11df1d45ebe1bb56eaa1) or higher. If they are not  already   using Teams, then recommend to your customers that they adopt Microsoft Teams   first. For Teams adoption guidance, see [Microsoft Teams Adoption](https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/).

If you are a Microsoft Partner, you can work with your Microsoft counterpart to facilitate Teams adoption. If you want to become a Microsoft Partner, see [ISV success program overview](https://www.microsoft.com/isv/program-benefits).

### Access to your apps

Ensure that  end-users have the appropriate licenses to access your app  on Teams. There are two types of apps in Teams store:

* **Custom apps**: Custom apps can be added to Teams from the Teams panel and can  setup and managed from the Teams admin center. While users  can view apps on the Teams panel, only admins can manage them from the Manage apps page.
* **Third-party apps**: Teams Store  provides many useful apps created by third-party software developers in addition to apps provided by Microsoft. While these apps are created by third-party providers,  Microsoft does rigorous validation of the functionality and security of these apps. For more information, see [Understand third-party apps in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/overview-third-party-apps).

Ensure that  end-users have access to your apps on Teams store. Admins can set up an app governance process that balances the wide-ranging requirements of users with your organization's IT policies, standards, and risk profiles. It may mean IT admins blocking access to some apps. For more information, see Create policies for app access.

## Understand how you can drive app adoption

You can help your customers drive adoption within their organizations by app adoption and usage related guidance. To do so, you can follow some or all the following steps.

> * **Perform internal enablement to support app adoption**: Share important and relevant information to IT admins and help end-users understand and adopt your apps. Provide an adoption toolkit for your app to achieve this. Define a rollout process and enablement trainings for your customer facing teams.
> * **Help admins to do app config and rollout**: Help the IT admins make the necessary configurations to enable your app for the end users in your customers' organizations. Provide a help guide for IT admins to understand the configuration steps.
> * **Educate users and drive awareness about your app**: Provide user guide for end-users that describes their jobs to be done (JTBD) and your app’s features. Promote awareness about your app and its use cases. You can conduct email campaigns, webinars, or social media engagements depending on your target audience.
> * **Provide support contact for IT admins and end-users**: As admins start to roll out the app and as users start to use it, they will reach out for support for the issues that they cannot resolve using your documentation. Timely help during this stage ensures quick onboarding and better retention.
> * **Track app adoption and usage using analytics**: Track your app adoption progress after the rollout and promptly resolve issues for the early adopters.    Your CSM or account manager can engage with the customer's organization and its IT admins to track adoption and provide support, if required.

## Step 1: Perform internal enablement to support app adoption

Within your own organization, you must streamline the app-related support and guidance programs. Internal readiness and enablement training programs for various business functions help to create good content, do targeted marketing, create an informed support team, and streamline the sales motion. All such activities and assets in turn ensure smooth app adoption journey for your customers and a seamless customer experience.

You must define a rollout process for your Teams app and make sure that:

* You incorporate a standard rollout process for onboarding a new client on the Teams app. If you are onboarding a customer on your SaaS application and the customer also uses Teams, ensure that the Teams app onboarding is done as part of your standard onboarding and not as a separate activity.
* Support professionals and CSMs are trained and are familiar with the nuances of your app, its value proposition, features, configuration steps, and the rollout process. Also, leverage the deployment guidance for admins.

### App installation and configuration guide

The target audience for this guide is the IT administrators in your customer's organization, and it should contain the following technical information to help them configure your apps on Teams:

* Prerequisites to install your app.
* How to configure security settings and permissions.

To understand how an IT admin can configure your app, see Help IT admins get your app adopted by their end-users. Also, see the Documentation for IT admins and decision makers, which contains a checklist of best practices and information required for an IT admin that need to be included.

### User guide to describe features to end-users

Provide a user guide for your app and cover the following topics:

* Installation instructions for your app from the Teams store.
* Key features and uses cases of your app. see Provide your app's use cases.
* How can users reach out for support?
* What are the end-user configuration settings, for example, profile setup?

For more information, see drive awareness about features with end-users.

### User awareness campaign  guide and assets for organizations

Awareness and training are the marketing and enablement segments of your overall app adoption strategy. This will ensure that your end-users are aware of the capabilities of the Teams app and should encourage them to install and sign into your app on Teams.

A campaign should be at the correct time in the adoption lifecycle and contextual reminders after a campaign can help drive the adoption. An example is a campaign that has communications spanning across pre-rollout days to build excitement, at the time of rollout to inform, and post-rollout to serve as a reminder.

Post-adoption, there is a need for continuous engagement to help existing users with their tasks and to gradually onboard late adopters. You can host interaction sessions with the community such as support webinars, office hours, and so on. You can build a community around your app, answer queries, recognize top users or MVPs in your community, and so on.

## Step 2: Help admins to do app config and rollout for their end-users

Admins create an app governance process that balances the wide-ranging requirements of end-users with their organization's IT policies, standards, and risk profiles. IT admins control the availability of and influence the adoption of apps within their organizations.

Teams admin center provides admins enterprise-grade controls and configurations to govern the apps. IT admins have complete control over the availability of apps for each user in various contexts, such as meetings, chats, and channels. IT admins accomplish the following tasks:

* Evaluate and allow apps.
*
